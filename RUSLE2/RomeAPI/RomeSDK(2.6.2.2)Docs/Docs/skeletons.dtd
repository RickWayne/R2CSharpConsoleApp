<!--
 External DTD for validating XML management skeleton (.SKEL) files exported by Rusle2.
 This is a common file format used by NRCS for management information.
 This can be added to an exported skeleton file by adding the line
    <!DOCTYPE management SYSTEM "(path to this file)">
-->

<!-- The root element
  "ver" is the version of this DTD used to generate the skeleton file.
        1.0  The base version
		1.1  Introduced optional <irrigation_dates> element
		     Note: this version is backwards compatible with 1.0
  "prog" is the program used to generate the skeleton file.
     It is 'RUSLE2' for the Rusle2 application.

<!ELEMENT op (date, name, veg?) >

<!-- The [start] date of the operation.
  This is exported by Ruse2 in mm/dd/yy format.
  Note that these are "simulation dates", which generally start with year 0 or year 1.
  These are not generally "real" calendar dates.

<!-- A vegetation associated with an operation.
-->
<!ELEMENT veg (name) >

<!-- A name of a management or an operation.
  These are encoded using XML character entities:
	" ==> &quot;

	< ==> &lt;
	> ==> &gt;
	\ ==> \		not encoded
	| ==> &#x7C;

	: ==> &#x3A;
	* ==> &#x2A;
	? ==> &#x3F;
  The management name is the name Rusle2 uses internally.
  An operation name is the name of a Rusle2 operation file.
